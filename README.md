bamboo_remote_agent_window
=========

Deploy a bamboo remote agent run on window server 2016 and sutiable to build
dotnet projects.

This is for act2 legacy project thus efforts has been made to be generic but
somehow it is best to consult the software requirements of the project to
figure it out what it is in this role. And you will see not much aprt from some
window and dot net sdk stuff.

Requirements
------------

- role win_base has been run to apply some basic window setup.

Role Variables
--------------

- `bamboo_agent_depends_chocolatey_packages` - optional
- `build_project_depends_chocolatey_packages` - optional
- `role_chocolatey_packages` - optional - is the union of the two above. They
   have default values required for bamboo-agent

- `bamboo_agent_user_name` - optional - default: bamboo
- `bamboo_agent_user_password` - required - no default and need to be set in inventory vault data.

These above variables purposes are explainable by its name.

- `bamboo_agent_home` - optional - default: c:\bamboo_agent
 
 directory where bamboo agent will put all its files and
 its build files etc. Should be large enough.

- `bamboo_agent_jarfile_name` - Optional - Default: atlassian-bamboo-agent-installer-5.15.7.jar based on current bamboo server.

 The exact jar file name - get it from the bamboo
 server. Each server has one specific for its version or deployment, be sure to
 get correct one.

- `bamboo_agent_jarfile_url` - Optional - Values might need to be updated in role
 or provided in inventory if bamboo server changes.
 
 The full url to get the agent jar file - example:
 "https://ci.xvt.technology/agentServer/agentInstaller/{{ bamboo_agent_jarfile_name }}"

- `bamboo_agent_server_url` - Optional - Values might need to be updated in role
   or provided in inventory if bamboo server changes.

 The url to contact to the bamboo server - eg.
 "https://{{ bamboo_server }}/agentServer/"

- `bamboo_token` - required. Values might need to be updated in role
 or provided in inventory if bamboo server changes.

 The secret (or not so) to put into the bamboo agent launch
 command to contact to the bamboo server. The value is get from the bamboo
 server GUI. Login and get somewhere to the agent status there should be a
 button 'Install remote agent' - get to that page and read. Many information is
 from there as well.

- `bamboo_agent_launch_cmd` - Optional - Default auto created based on the other
 variables above
 
 The agent complete launch command.

- `bamboo_agent_capabilities` - Optional - 
 contains the textual lines of the bamboo-capabilities.properties file to set
 our custom capabilities.
 The default value always has a variable below ...

- `cross_account_capability` - Optional - Default: empty
 deploy into a line <cross_account_capability>=yes into the cap file.

- `bamboo_agent_extra_capabilities` - Optional - Default: empty
 This will be appended to the default
 bamboo_agent_capabilities to allow inventory to add more lines into the
 capability file.

 So by default if bamboo_agent_capabilities is not provided it is defaulted to
 the first line contains `cross_account_capability`=yes and then
 `bamboo_agent_extra_capabilities`
